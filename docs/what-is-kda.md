Message regarding exchange listing from Kadena CEO, Will Martino:

> “While exchange listing was always a high priority and something we’ve been working on for a couple months, launching the platform came first. Now that we’ve delivered the platform, getting listed on a major exchange takes its place at the top of our goals. As such, we’re working to see if we can get listed on a larger exchange and also talking to smaller exchanges to explore all of our options. Needless to say, diligence has increased in the current regulatory landscape and that impacts the listing process.

> Listing on a premier exchange is a months-long process and it is not something that we have full control over. Moreover, the process is very sensitive and thus we’re unable to share updates and statuses with the transparency we’d prefer. When we reach an agreement and after a contract gets signed, it can take 4-6 weeks for integration. However, we look forward to making an announcement as soon as there is more news.”
