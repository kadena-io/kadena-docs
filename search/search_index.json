Update to the latest version of Chainweaver \u00b6 Upgrading Chainweaver is an essential part of keeping your crypto assets safe and enjoying new features for interacting with the Kadena blockchain ecosystem. The latest version of Chainweaver will always be available for download at https://www.kadena.io/chainweaver . Note Ensure you have a secure connection before downloading any applications. Most issues can be resolved simply by updating to the latest version of Chainweaver. Networks \u00b6 Different networks in Chainweaver \u00b6 Chainweaver allows you to interact with different networks, including the main network (\u201cMainnet\u201d) and a test network (\u201cTestnet\u201d) Mainnet is the primary live blockchain network where assets of value can be transferred and smart contract services can be called. Testnet is a network with which you can safely test various blockchain interactions without the risk of losing valuable assets. Both Mainnet and Testnet are fully operational, real blockchains. It is only Testnet, however, where you can acquire KDA coins for free from a coin faucet . Naturally, account balances cannot move between networks. Change networks \u00b6 You can change the network with which you are actively interacting by selecting the drop-down arrows beside the displayed network in the Network Display top bar. Simply select the desired network from the available list and confirm the selection. The keys displayed in the wallet will persist across networks, while the accounts list will refresh to display those that you have added on the chosen network. Create a custom network \u00b6 You can add your own custom network by selecting the appropriate option from the Settings section. To create a new network, you will have to define a network name then enter the addresses for the nodes to which you would like the network to connect. Node status is displayed with a traffic light style indicator. Note Custom networks are defined locally and will only be visible within the application that created it. It is recommended that a network connect to at least 3 nodes. Keys, Accounts, and Ownership \u00b6 Understanding Keys vs. Accounts \u00b6 In brief, Keys sign transactions and Accounts may be governed by one or multiple keys. With most blockchains, accounts are modeled as simply public/private keypairs. This one-to-one model keeps things simple, but runs into problems when account control requires a many-to-many model (such as with jointly owned or majority ruled accounts). Kadena natively supports multiple keys governing the same account, and thus the distinction between Keys and Accounts becomes important. Every Account is governed by a keyset which must be defined when creating any Account. Keysets are composed of two parts; (1) a set of keys and (2) a predicate Set of keys: a list of public keys that are associated to the account Predicate: a governance function that determines which keys are allowed to make choices for the account when it comes to transactions (e.g. do all keys need to be present? only one? two? etc.) Summarily, keysets look like the following as JSON data: { \"keys\": [\"pubkey1\", \"pubkey2\",...,\"pubkeyN\"], \"pred\": \"some governance function\" } When signing a transaction, the list of private keys supplied as signing key pairs will be checked against the keyset and predicate to ensure that not only are all keys that need to be present accounted for but also that the predicate is satisfied. Generate a Key \u00b6 The first step towards transacting on the Kadena blockchain is to generate a key pair. Chainweaver automatically generates your first key. Select the \u201cGenerate Key\u201d button to add additional keys to your wallet, then continue to Accounts. Add an account \u00b6 Accounts are effectively equivalent to your identity on the blockchain. When you add an Account in Chainweaver, you will be able to view information about it such as its keyset info and balance on each of the known chains. Select \u201c+ Add Account\u201d to view existing accounts or create a new account. Optionally, you can add personal notes beside any account. This field is never seen by the blockchain, and only serves as a personal reference to organize a user\u2019s wallet. Create an account \u00b6 To create, and effectively own, an account name on Kadena, there must be a record of it on the blockchain. The recommended method for creating an account is to simply transfer some funds to it. In doing so, you transfer to and create the account in a single transaction. Before transferring to any account, first check to see whether the account name already exists. Do this by selecting the \u201cAdd Account\u201d button and entering the desired account\u2019s name. If the account does not exist, then you will see \u201cDoes not exist\u201d as the balance for the corresponding Chain ID row. There are two ways to perform the \u201ctransfer & create\u201d operation. Method 1: Tx Builder Select \u201cReceive\u201d beside the desired account\u2019s Chain ID row to open the dialog Follow the on-screen instructions to define the keyset Copy the generated Tx Builder and paste it into the To field in Chainweaver's transfer tool or send it to someone else so they can use it to complete the transfer Method 2: Manual entry Open the Transfer section and fill-in the fields Expand the Owner Keyset sub-section to define how keys will govern this new account Select \u201cSign & Transfer\u201d to complete the transaction Note For convenience, Chainweaver will automatically define the keyset for accounts that have the same name as the single public key which controls it. Remember that the Kadena public blockchain network is comprised of many chains braided together. In effect, each chain is a standalone blockchain, therefore you will have to create your desired account on each chain for which you want it to exist. Naturally, the same account name will have a different account balance on each chain, and may also have different owners or a different keyset. Always be sure to take note of the chain on which you are transacting. Remove an account \u00b6 To remove an account from view, select the Details button beside the desired account Select \u201cRemove Account\u201d Read the warning message and confirm your selection by selecting \u201cRemove Account\u201d Account ownership \u00b6 Kadena natively supports multiple keys governing the same account, allowing for dynamic account controls such as jointly owned accounts or the ability to rotate which keys may govern an account. As a result of this novel capability, it is important for users to clearly understand which accounts they own and which they may not own. For convenience, Chainweaver displays whether you are the owner of any account that you are watching. If Chainweaver generated all of the keys in an account, it will indicate \u201cyes\u201d for Owner If Chainweaver generated some but not all keys in an account, it will indicate \u201cjoint\u201d for Owner If Chainweaver generated none of the keys in an account, it will indicate \u201cno\u201d for Owner Transactions \u00b6 Among other powerful user controls, two concepts are introduced through Chainweaver which provide the user with greater transparency and control; (1) granting capabilities and (2) Tx Builder. Granting capabilities Performing transfers necessitates a call to the blockchain\u2019s coin contract. This contract describes the rules for transferring coins and one such rule requires that the Sender account grant the capability to transfer coins in order for the transaction to be submitted. The act of granting capabilities is akin to authorizing or signing a transaction. In more advanced scenarios some contracts require multiple capabilities to be granted. This concept gives the user greater control and transparency to what they are signing. Tx Builder This is a JSON blob including the necessary information to build a transaction. For simple transfers it might include just an account name and chain ID, like this: { \"account\": \"alice\", \"chain\": \"5\" } For account creation it might also include a keyset, like this: { \"account\": \"alice\", \"chain\": \"5\", \"keyset\": { \"keys\": [\"368698bf0354b0c04884a185a7eefd20500562cad23bf9c25eee53ddc0ba7d7b\"], \"pred\": \"keys-all\" } } While users will never need to compose this code themselves, it is important to become familiar with reading it to understand how some blockchain operations work. Note These two concepts are not necessary to understand or use in order to perform KDA transfers. Receive Kadena (KDA) \u00b6 There are two recommended approaches for receiving KDA Method 1: Tx Builder \u2014 best for receiving KDA from a sender who is also using Chainweaver Select \u201cReceive\u201d beside the desired account\u2019s Chain ID row to open the dialog Copy the Tx Builder and share with the sender to complete the transfer Method 2: Account Name + Chain ID \u2014 best for receiving KDA from a sender who is not using Chainweaver Share both your Account name and chain ID with the sender to complete the transfer Note If the account to which you are receiving KDA does not yet exist, then the sender will define the keyset which governs the new account. Once KDA has been transferred, ensure that account ownership was set-up to your liking Send Kadena (KDA) \u00b6 Since the Kadena public blockchain network braids multiple chains together, you can transfer KDA within a single chain or across two different chains. Transfer between the same chain Navigate to the Account section and select \u201cTransfer Coins\u201d to reveal the transfer tool. Fill in the required fields then select the \"Sign & Transfer\" button. This will open the Sign Transfer dialog which allows you to configure transaction settings. Once satisfied, select Next to view the Signatures tab. If any external signatures are required, you will be prompted to enter them here. Preview the transaction to ensure the Summary Data and Transaction Result output displays the desired outcome. If everything looks correct, select Send Transfer to submit the transaction to the blockchain. Transfer between different chains This process has one distinct difference from transfers on the same chain. This time when you configure the transaction, you must select two Gas Payers: Gas payer on the originating chain to initiate the transfer Gas payer on the destination chain to redeem the transfer It may seem unusual to have to pay for gas twice, but consider what is happening with a cross-chain transfer. In this scenario you are moving coins between two different blockchains, each with their own ledger. Therefore gas on one chain cannot pay for executing operations on a different chain. Transfer from non-Chainweaver accounts In addition to signing transactions from accounts which are owned within the wallet, Chainweaver also provides an interface to sign transactions from accounts which are not owned within the wallet. Chainweaver does this by auto-detecting whether the sending account is owned by the wallet. If the sending account is not owned by the wallet, Chainweaver will present a field for the user to enter the required private key(s). This special feature makes it easier for users to transfer KDA into Chainweaver from external wallets and exchanges. Adjust gas price and gas limit \u00b6 Before you submit any transaction or deploy any smart contract, you will have the opportunity to configure a few settings. You can adjust both the Gas Price and the Gas Limit of your transaction. As either of these settings are adjusted, you can see how these changes might affect Transaction Speed and Max Transaction Fee. Note Chainweaver does not charge a fee to send or receive a transaction. All transaction fees go directly to miners as compensation for providing the compute power required to execute the operation. Track your transaction \u00b6 Once a transaction has been submitted, Chainweaver will display the Transfer Status as it moves through progress states. The average block time in the Kadena network is 30 seconds. So depending on the Transaction Speed you assigned, it may take several blocks before your transaction is successfully mined. Transaction success : When the transaction has been successfully mined in a block, a Transaction Result will display. Transaction failure : If the transaction fails at any progress state then a red \u201cX\u201d will appear beside the failing state. If you have a request key from a previously submitted transaction, you can also display its result by selecting the \u201cCheck Tx Status\u201d button. Smart Contracts \u00b6 The ability to write, deploy, and call smart contracts from within Chainweaver makes it one of the most comprehensive workbench tools for blockchain. Navigate to the Contracts section and utilize the integrated development environment (IDE) for developing and testing Pact smart contracts. Pact is the safe and simple smart contract language used for interacting with the Kadena blockchain. Visit https://pactlang.org/ for developer tutorials covering key concepts and real projects you can deploy yourself. Deploy your own smart contract \u00b6 Once you have written the code for your new smart contract in the code editor, check the ENV tab of the tool panel on the right side for any error messages that might be displayed. Once you are satisfied with your code, you can either select \u201cLoad into REPL\u201d or \u201cDeploy.\u201d \u201cLoad into REPL\u201d will execute the editor text within the local REPL environment so that you can test and interact with the contract \u201cDeploy\u201d will begin the process of configuring the smart contract for execution on the blockchain Should you select \u201cDeploy,\u201d you will next be prompted to designate the transaction destination and settings. On the \u201cSign\u201d tab you must enter any new capabilities as defined in your contract code, then select the account to authorize each capability. Once all required fields have been entered, select the \u201cPreview\u201d button. Here you will be able to review and confirm details before submitting the transaction. Call an existing smart contract \u00b6 Once a contract has been deployed, it will show up in the \u201cDeployed Contracts\u201d table under the \u201cModule Explorer\u201d tab of the Contracts tool panel. Contracts can be filtered by chain or through search. Select \u201cView\u201d beside your chosen contract to reveal all of the available functions to call. Select \u201cCall\u201d beside your chosen function to open a three-part dialog: Parameters: enter the required parameters Configuration: choose the transaction settings Sign: grant the required capabilities Preview the transaction, then select \u201cCreate Transaction\u201d to execute the operation. Interact with Dapps \u00b6 As a user, interacting with dapps is simple. Chainweaver takes advantage of a novel wallet signing API which facilitates communication between dapps and wallets. First ensure your Chainweaver desktop application is open. When you\u2019re ready to start some transaction with a dapp, initiate the request by submitting the required information (e.g. account name) to the dapp. Once a call has been made, by pressing a button on the dapp interface or through some other means, the signing API will hit Chainweaver. When Chainweaver receives an API call, a new dialog will appear within Chainweaver displaying input data from the dapp. Review the transaction details and complete the flow as you would for any other transaction; configure settings, grant capabilities, preview and create. Security and Access \u00b6 Key pair generation \u00b6 Kadena uses Ed25519 public/private key pair signatures. Chainweaver can be used to easily generate compatible key pairs. Alternatively, you can generate key pairs yourself by following any kind of Ed25519 key generation method such as this one contributed to our community GitHub. Learn more about Ed25519 here ). Basic safety tips \u00b6 As with any valuable asset, it is important to establish a secure and reliable method for controlling who has access to it. While Chainweaver is designed to satisfy strict security standards, you are ultimately responsible for maintaining the security of your wallet\u2019s access credentials\u2014the password and recovery phrase. Passwords : Consider using a password manager to generate a strong password with randomness of character types. If you decide to create a password yourself, make sure it is not the same or similar to any other password you have ever used. Recovery phrases : This 12-word phrase is the master seed that generates all your wallet\u2019s public/private key pairs. With this phrase, anyone can control your wallet, even from another device. Consider securing more than one copy to prevent a single point of failure from events like fires, loss, etc. Kadena does not control any of your personal/private data on our servers. Never share passwords or recovery phrases with anyone, including the Kadena team. We will never ask for you to provide this. If someone claims that we do, insist on not sharing. Who can access your account \u00b6 Anyone with your wallet's password, private keys or recovery phrase can access your account. Passwords, private keys, and recovery phrases are in the users\u2019 hands and are the users\u2019 responsibility. Chainweaver is simply an interface that allows you to more easily interact with your accounts and the Kadena blockchain. Lost password and/or recovery phrase \u00b6 Lost password If you lose your password, you can reset it by using your 12-word recovery phrase to restore the wallet with a new password. Lost both password and recovery phrase If you lose both your password and recovery phrase, you will permanently lose access to any accounts and their funds forever. Kadena does not manage accounts with information such as passwords, private keys, or recovery phrases. We only have access to the information that is publicly available on the blockchain. We do not have servers and we do not hold your assets. Change password \u00b6 Change your password by navigating to the Settings section and selecting the appropriate button. Export wallet \u00b6 Export your wallet by navigating to the Settings section and selecting the appropriate button. Exporting wallet data will generate an encrypted file containing sensitive and non-sensitive information available within the wallet. The file will be protected by the wallet password that was in use at time of export. Store this file in a secure location and do not alter its contents. The wallet data to be exported within this file includes: Generated public/private key pairs Added accounts Account notes Network configuration Transaction configuration Note This password-protected wallet file can be imported to Chainweaver as a recovery method to restore the state of the wallet at the time the file was created. View and export transaction log \u00b6 View and export your wallet\u2019s transaction log by navigating to the Settings section and selecting the appropriate button. Log out \u00b6 The \u201cLog out\u201d button in the lower-left of the Section menu will lock your wallet. A locked wallet cannot sign transactions or receive signing API calls. Codebase \u00b6 To find out about the latest improvements to Chainweaver, view all activity available at the open-source repository on GitHub here .

Keysets are composed of two parts; (1) a set of keys and (2) a predicate Set of keys: a list of public keys that are associated to the account Predicate: a governance function that determines which keys are allowed to make choices for the account when it comes to transactions (e.g. do all keys need to be present? only one? two? etc.) Summarily, keysets look like the following as JSON data: { \"keys\": [\"pubkey1\", \"pubkey2\",...,\"pubkeyN\"], \"pred\": \"some governance function\" } When signing a transaction, the list of private keys supplied as signing key pairs will be checked against the keyset and predicate to ensure that not only are all keys that need to be present accounted for but also that the predicate is satisfied.","title":"Understanding Keys vs. Accounts"},{"location":"Chainweaver-Support/#generate-a-key","text":"The first step towards transacting on the Kadena blockchain is to generate a key pair.

Granting capabilities Performing transfers necessitates a call to the blockchain\u2019s coin contract. This contract describes the rules for transferring coins and one such rule requires that the Sender account grant the capability to transfer coins in order for the transaction to be submitted. The act of granting capabilities is akin to authorizing or signing a transaction. In more advanced scenarios some contracts require multiple capabilities to be granted. This concept gives the user greater control and transparency to what they are signing. Tx Builder This is a JSON blob including the necessary information to build a transaction. For simple transfers it might include just an account name and chain ID, like this: { \"account\": \"alice\", \"chain\": \"5\" } For account creation it might also include a keyset, like this: { \"account\": \"alice\", \"chain\": \"5\", \"keyset\": { \"keys\": [\"368698bf0354b0c04884a185a7eefd20500562cad23bf9c25eee53ddc0ba7d7b\"], \"pred\": \"keys-all\" } } While users will never need to compose this code themselves, it is important to become familiar with reading it to understand how some blockchain operations work.

In this scenario you are moving coins between two different blockchains, each with their own ledger. Therefore gas on one chain cannot pay for executing operations on a different chain. Transfer from non-Chainweaver accounts In addition to signing transactions from accounts which are owned within the wallet, Chainweaver also provides an interface to sign transactions from accounts which are not owned within the wallet. Chainweaver does this by auto-detecting whether the sending account is owned by the wallet.

How does Kadena scale? \u00b6 Kadena\u2019s public blockchain scales by providing a mechanism to asynchronously produce many blocks on different peer chains all at the same height, with each block requiring a fraction of the hash power of the total network. This configuration drastically increases the number of transactions per second over the total network. How does Kadena deal with congestion? \u00b6 Transaction costs will rise as the number of transactions rise on one chain. You can set up an account on a less congested chain, where transaction costs are cheaper, and move your tokens through a simple burn-receipt using on-chain SPV. Miners have economic incentive to cooperate with reconfiguring the network to a larger size when the entire network starts to become congested. What does it mean to \u201cbraid multiple chains\u201d? \u00b6 Braiding chains together was first proposed for security purposes. In effect, chains are \u201cbraided\u201d as each chain\u2019s newly mined block incorporates the Merkle roots of its peer chains.

Out of date binaries One of the most prevalent is that a node is attempting to enter the network with out of date binaries or dependencies. For example, if a node is attempting to synchronize with an improper version of librocksdb , then peer synchronization will fail. The solution is to make that all are up to date with the most recent official release of chainweb-node . Timeout exceptions If the synchronizing node fails to provide timely feedback, nodes will receive a timeout exception. In general this is fine, and only considered a warning. No cause for alarm, and nodes can sync to alternative nodes in the meantime. These exceptions are usually post-fixed by a ConnectionTimeout statement. Something went wrong \"Something went wrong\" exceptions are thrown when an internal server error occurs due to misconfiguration.

Regenerate deleted configs \u00b6 Issue ./chainweb-node --print-config to create a fresh config yaml. Mining KDA \u00b6 Discover peers to mine \u00b6 Every chainweb node maintains a list of peers. If you want a list of peers to mine, curl the /cut/peer endpoint on any node to discover its list of peers. A good start would be any bootstrap node: \u2192 curl -sk \"https://us-e2.chainweb.com/chainweb/0.0/mainnet01/cut/peer\" | python -m json.tool | grep hostname \"hostname\" : \"foo.com\" \"hostname\" : \"blah.org\" ... See if a node is minable \u00b6 Keep up to date with the list of minable nodes, or to test or yourself, point your miner at any of the available nodes and see if it starts mining. This is easiest if you set the default log level to debug . For example: ./chainweb-miner cpu --cores 2 --node us-w2.chainweb.com:443 --miner-account <some account> --miner-key <some key> --log-level debug Balance isn't showing up after mining a block \u00b6 Proof-of-Work algorithms rely on the fact that only one winning chain is chosen after a certain length of time. In the meantime, there can be many competing chains which can become several (up to 10's of) blocks long on which you'll see your miner potentially winning blocks. When a winner is chosen and the forks resolve, only those blocks mined by miners on the winning chain will be perceived by the network to be correct, and they will be awarded a block reward. As a result, you can do mining for a while and win a ton of blocks, but if you're mining on a fork you may subsequently not see a change in balance if the fork does not win the race. The solution to this is to help contribute to a healthy distribution of hash power across the network by running your own node and making sure not to centralize your mining attempts on particularly powerful nodes. 404 Errors \u00b6 Miners will receive 404 errors when miners fail to connect to a node. This can happen for a variety of reasons: Network misconfiguration If you do not have incoming and outgoing SSL traffic enabled on your router, miners will 404. Please make sure that you have the correct router configuration. NATs tend to be a problem if you are running on AWS. Make sure this is off . The node is down If you receive a 404, the node may be down. Diagnose this by either pinging a node with ping -c 3 <node ip> and seeing if it pings back or sending a cURL request to a node's health check endpoint: curl -k https://<node-ip>:443/health-check A healthy node should return the following: Health check OK. If a node is down, simply switch your miner to a new node which is up.

In doing so, Kadena solves many of the problems that have impeded widespread blockchain adoption to date including scalability, security, and ease-of-use. 1. Scalability \u00b6 The public blockchain is a Proof of Work protocol that has solved layer-1 scalability. This is achieved by braiding together several Bitcoin-like chains. As transaction volume increases, the network can expand to larger configurations (eg. from 10 chains to 20 chains) and deliver higher throughput capacity. 2.

Moreover, the process is very sensitive and thus we\u2019re unable to share updates and statuses with the transparency we\u2019d prefer.
